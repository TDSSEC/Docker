# DockerImages

Various Docker images I have created...  
More info can be found in the **README** files in the respective directories above.

## XSS-Finder
Utilises xsscrapy script and an automated dork scanner (DorkScan) to help find XSS.  
Easy to use and will find many XSS vulnerabilties from vulnerable sites

## Kali Linux
As the Title suggests, it's Kali Linux base Docker image with additional packages and github Tools ready to go.

## OSINT
This uses spiderfoot to perform OSINT.  
Requires you to pass the spiderfoot directory on your local machine into the docker container.  
Why? You can then use your API keys without having them stored publically on GitHub... :)
